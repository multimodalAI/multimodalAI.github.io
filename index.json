Fixed term for 36 months with flexible starting date. For more information, watch the information session recording on YouTube and check out the Q\u0026amp;A summary.\nI am a Professor of Machine Learning, Head of AI Research Engineering, and AI Strategy Lead at the Department of Computer Science, the Turing Academic Lead, and Insigneo Research Director for Healthcare Data / AI, the University of Sheffield. I am also the Machine Learning Theme Lead for Sheffield in the N8 Centre of Excellence in Computationally Intensive Research and the lead organiser of the Alan Turing Institute’s interest group on Meta-learning for multimodal data (welcome to sign-up and join). I lead the development of a course on An Introduction to Transparent Machine Learning, part of the Alan Turing Institute’s online learning courses in responsible AI.\nMy research focuses on developing translational AI technologies for better analysing multimodal data in healthcare and beyond, particularly multidimensional data and heterogeneous graphs in bioinformatics and medical imaging. I lead the development of the PyKale library to provide more accessible machine learning from multiple sources for interdisciplinary research, officially part of the PyTorch ecosystem.\nI serve as an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems, and World Scientific Annual Review of Artificial Intelligence. I served as an area chair of IJCAI2021, and a senior program committee member of IJCAI and AAAI since 2018. I was a recipient of a Turing Network Development Award, an Amazon Research Award, an AAAI Outstanding PC Member Award, a Hong Kong Research Grants Council Early Career Award, and an IEEE CIS Outstanding PhD Dissertation Award, and a joint-recipient of a Wellcome Trust Innovator Award and an NIHR AI in Health and Care Award. I am a Senior Member of IEEE.\nThree of my MSc dissertation students received the Fretwell-Downing Prize for the best MSc Dissertation in their respective years (P. Bai in 2017, H. Xu in 2019, and M. N. I. Suvon in 2022). See the bottom for the whereabouts of my past team members.\nPhD enquiries: Email me ONE PDF including CV, a statement on why and your source of funding, 1-3 papers, and transcripts before applying.
